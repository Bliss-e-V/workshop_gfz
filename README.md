# 🌍 Self-Supervised Learning with E-OBS Climate Data

This repository demonstrates self-supervised learning approaches for E-OBS precipitation data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service.

## 🌦️ Dataset

We work with E-OBS daily precipitation data from the [European Climate Assessment & Dataset project](https://surfobs.climate.copernicus.eu/dataaccess/access_eobs.php). The dataset provides:

- **Daily precipitation sums** across Europe
- **0.25° grid resolution** (~25km spatial resolution)
- **Time period**: 1950-2024 (version 31.0e)
- **Spatial coverage**: Europe (-40.4°E to 75.4°E, 25.4°N to 75.4°N)

## 🎯 Self-Supervised Learning Approaches

### 1. Temporal Prediction 🔮
- **Task**: Predict next day's precipitation from past 3 days
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based model with patch embeddings
- **Learning**: Temporal patterns and weather evolution
- **Use case**: Weather forecasting, temporal pattern learning

### 2. Masked Modeling 🎭
- **Task**: Reconstruct masked spatial regions of precipitation maps
- **Architecture**: U-Net encoder-decoder with skip connections
- **Masking strategies**: Random patches, blocks, irregular patterns
- **Use case**: Data imputation, spatial relationship learning

## 💡 Key Insights

Self-supervised learning with weather data presents unique challenges:
- **Weather chaos**: Small changes can lead to large differences
- **Non-linear dynamics**: Precipitation patterns are complex
- **Multi-scale patterns**: From local to synoptic scales
- **Missing context**: Need temperature, pressure, humidity for full picture

This repository demonstrates both the potential and limitations of self-supervised learning for climate data.

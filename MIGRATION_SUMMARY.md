# Migration Summary: Transformers ‚Üí Torchvision ViT

## Overview
Successfully migrated the codebase from HuggingFace transformers to native PyTorch torchvision Vision Transformer implementations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- **Removed**: `transformers>=4.35.0`
- **Removed**: `huggingface-hub>=0.17.0`
- **Removed**: `accelerate>=0.24.0`
- **Kept**: `torchvision>=0.15.0` (already present)

### 2. Model Implementation (`src/models.py`)
- **Updated imports**: 
  - ‚ùå `from transformers import ViTModel, ViTConfig`
  - ‚úÖ `from torchvision.models import vit_b_16, ViT_B_16_Weights`

- **SatelliteViT class**:
  - Now uses `vit_b_16(weights=ViT_B_16_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)` for pre-trained models
  - Custom classification head built by replacing `vit.heads`
  - Simplified attention visualization (torchvision doesn't expose attention by default)

- **FloodViT class**:
  - Similar migration to torchvision's `vit_b_16`
  - Binary classification head with simplified architecture

### 3. Notebook Updates (`notebooks/01_workshop_main.ipynb`)
- **Cell 0**: Updated description from "HuggingFace integration" to "Torchvision native ViT implementation"
- **Cell 13**: Replaced HuggingFace pipeline demo with torchvision ViT demo
- **Cell 14**: Updated summary to reflect native PyTorch implementation

## Key Benefits

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Torchvision ViT
1. **Reduced Dependencies**: No need for HuggingFace transformers, accelerate, or hub
2. **Native PyTorch**: Better integration with PyTorch ecosystem
3. **Production Ready**: Optimized for inference and deployment
4. **Smaller Package Size**: Fewer external dependencies to install
5. **Better Performance**: Native PyTorch implementation optimizations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-offs
1. **Attention Visualization**: Torchvision doesn't expose attention weights by default
   - Would need custom hooks to capture attention patterns
   - Simplified visualization for now
2. **Model Variety**: Fewer pre-trained model variants compared to HuggingFace
   - Currently using ViT-B/16 as the standard implementation

## Model Performance Comparison
After migration, the models maintain similar architectures:

| Model | Parameters | Architecture |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| SatelliteCNN | 111,659,338 | Custom CNN for land-cover |
| SatelliteViT | 86,199,050 | Torchvision ViT-B/16 + custom head |
| FloodCNN | 2,552,962 | Lightweight CNN for binary classification |
| FloodViT | 85,898,882 | Torchvision ViT-B/16 + binary head |

## Testing
‚úÖ All models tested successfully:
- Land-cover classification models work correctly
- Flood detection models work correctly
- Factory functions create appropriate models
- Forward passes generate expected output shapes

## Next Steps (Optional)
If advanced attention visualization is needed:
1. Implement custom forward hooks to capture attention weights
2. Create attention visualization utilities for torchvision ViT
3. Consider hybrid approach: use torchvision for inference, custom attention extraction for visualization

## Migration Status: ‚úÖ Complete
The codebase now uses native PyTorch torchvision ViT implementations with reduced dependencies and improved production readiness. 

## üîß Masked Modeling Training Fix (2024-01-XX)

### Problem
The masked modeling training on the cluster was failing with the error:
```
ERROR - Masked model training failed: No inf checks were recorded for this optimizer.
```

This error typically occurs when using mixed precision training (16-bit) with PyTorch Lightning, where the gradient scaler doesn't properly handle inf/nan values in gradients.

### Root Cause
1. **Mixed Precision Issues**: The script was using `'16-mixed'` precision which can cause gradient scaling problems
2. **Complex Model Architecture**: The masked modeling U-Net has more complex gradients than temporal prediction
3. **Numerical Instability**: Masked loss calculation can produce edge cases with inf/nan values

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Changed Precision Strategy**
```python
# Before: '16-mixed' precision
'precision': '16-mixed'

# After: 32-bit precision for stability
'precision': '32-true'
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Training Configuration**
- Added `create_robust_trainer()` function with better numerical stability
- Enhanced gradient clipping with norm-based algorithm
- Added finite value checks in early stopping
- Improved checkpoint saving with better monitoring

#### 3. **Numerical Stability Improvements**
- Added `torch.nan_to_num()` for all inputs/outputs
- Enhanced loss clamping to prevent extreme values
- Better error handling and logging for numerical issues
- More robust metric calculation

#### 4. **Optimizer Improvements**
- Changed from `ReduceLROnPlateau` to `CosineAnnealingLR` for better stability
- Added explicit epsilon and beta parameters for AdamW
- Disabled problematic features like gradient norm tracking

### Key Changes in Files:

#### `train_ssl_cluster.py`:
- `detect_and_configure_device()`: Changed to 32-bit precision
- `create_robust_trainer()`: New function with enhanced stability
- `create_enhanced_callbacks()`: Better monitoring and checkpointing

#### `src/models.py`:
- `MaskedModelingLightningModule`: Enhanced numerical stability
- Added `torch.nan_to_num()` for all tensors
- Improved loss clamping and error handling
- Better optimizer configuration

### Expected Results
1. **Stable Training**: No more gradient scaling errors
2. **Better Convergence**: More stable loss curves
3. **Robust Monitoring**: Better handling of edge cases
4. **Consistent Performance**: Reliable training across different runs

### Performance Impact
- **Speed**: Slightly slower due to 32-bit precision instead of 16-bit
- **Memory**: ~2x memory usage compared to 16-bit (but still fits in 40GB GPU)
- **Accuracy**: Potentially better due to higher numerical precision
- **Reliability**: Significantly improved training stability

### Usage
No changes needed in usage - the script will automatically use the enhanced configuration:
```bash
python train_ssl_cluster.py --model masked --epochs 40
python train_ssl_cluster.py --model both --epochs 50
```

The improvements apply to both models but are particularly beneficial for the masked modeling training.

# Migration Summary: Transformers → Torchvision ViT

## Overview
Successfully migrated the codebase from HuggingFace transformers to native PyTorch torchvision Vision Transformer implementations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- **Removed**: `transformers>=4.35.0`
- **Removed**: `huggingface-hub>=0.17.0`
- **Removed**: `accelerate>=0.24.0`
- **Kept**: `torchvision>=0.15.0` (already present)

### 2. Model Implementation (`src/models.py`)
- **Updated imports**: 
  - ❌ `from transformers import ViTModel, ViTConfig`
  - ✅ `from torchvision.models import vit_b_16, ViT_B_16_Weights`

- **SatelliteViT class**:
  - Now uses `vit_b_16(weights=ViT_B_16_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)` for pre-trained models
  - Custom classification head built by replacing `vit.heads`
  - Simplified attention visualization (torchvision doesn't expose attention by default)

- **FloodViT class**:
  - Similar migration to torchvision's `vit_b_16`
  - Binary classification head with simplified architecture

### 3. Notebook Updates (`notebooks/01_workshop_main.ipynb`)
- **Cell 0**: Updated description from "HuggingFace integration" to "Torchvision native ViT implementation"
- **Cell 13**: Replaced HuggingFace pipeline demo with torchvision ViT demo
- **Cell 14**: Updated summary to reflect native PyTorch implementation

## Key Benefits

### ✅ Advantages of Torchvision ViT
1. **Reduced Dependencies**: No need for HuggingFace transformers, accelerate, or hub
2. **Native PyTorch**: Better integration with PyTorch ecosystem
3. **Production Ready**: Optimized for inference and deployment
4. **Smaller Package Size**: Fewer external dependencies to install
5. **Better Performance**: Native PyTorch implementation optimizations

### ⚠️ Trade-offs
1. **Attention Visualization**: Torchvision doesn't expose attention weights by default
   - Would need custom hooks to capture attention patterns
   - Simplified visualization for now
2. **Model Variety**: Fewer pre-trained model variants compared to HuggingFace
   - Currently using ViT-B/16 as the standard implementation

## Model Performance Comparison
After migration, the models maintain similar architectures:

| Model | Parameters | Architecture |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| SatelliteCNN | 111,659,338 | Custom CNN for land-cover |
| SatelliteViT | 86,199,050 | Torchvision ViT-B/16 + custom head |
| FloodCNN | 2,552,962 | Lightweight CNN for binary classification |
| FloodViT | 85,898,882 | Torchvision ViT-B/16 + binary head |

## Testing
✅ All models tested successfully:
- Land-cover classification models work correctly
- Flood detection models work correctly
- Factory functions create appropriate models
- Forward passes generate expected output shapes

## Next Steps (Optional)
If advanced attention visualization is needed:
1. Implement custom forward hooks to capture attention weights
2. Create attention visualization utilities for torchvision ViT
3. Consider hybrid approach: use torchvision for inference, custom attention extraction for visualization

## Migration Status: ✅ Complete
The codebase now uses native PyTorch torchvision ViT implementations with reduced dependencies and improved production readiness.
